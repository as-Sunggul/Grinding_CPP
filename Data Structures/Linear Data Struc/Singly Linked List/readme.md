1. add_first()      : add a new element at the beginning of the list
2. add_nth()        : add a new element at the nth position of the list
                      the nth element before adding will be the (n+1)th element afterwards
3. add_last()       : add a new element at the end of the list
4. delete_begin()   : delete an element from the beginning of the list
5. delete_nth()     : delete an element at the nth position of the list
6. delete_end()     : delete an element from the end of the list
7. reverse()        : reversing a list
8. show()           : print out the list
